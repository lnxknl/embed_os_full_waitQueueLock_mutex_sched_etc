OpenCV requires too much read-only memory (it's mostly code), so you have to
use QSPI flash to run it.

Brief instruction:

1. Compile this template:
	make confload-platform/opencv/stm32f7discovery
	make

2. Extract readonly sections from ELF
	arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary build/base/bin/embox tmp.bin \
		--only-section=.text --only-section=.rodata \
		--only-section='.ARM.ex* \ # This is for CPP exceptions
		--only-section=.data

3. Now load tmp.bin to QSPI memory. Currently there's no easy way to do it with
Embox itself, but you can use some third-party scripts etc.

4. Build simple config with `goto` command, write it to regular flash memory

5. Jump to <start> symbol of opencv template
