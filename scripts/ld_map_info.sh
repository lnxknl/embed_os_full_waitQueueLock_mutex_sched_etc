# Short reference on awk to ease understanding the scripts below:
# - awk is controlled by instructions of the form 'pattern { action }'
# - pattern defines when action is performed
# - pattern or action may be omitted, but not both
# - pattern value may be BEGIN, END or <expression>
# - omitted pattern means 'match all'
# - omitted action  means '{ print }'
# - awk splits input lines and stores resulting parts in variables $1, $2, $3, â€¦
#   $0 holds current input line


# $0               current input line
# ~                regular expression matching
# ENVIRON["NAME"]  access to environment variables
# /r/              checks if current input line matches regular expression 'r'
# NF               number of fields obtained after splitting the input line
#
# This script basically does the following: "if current or previous line matches pattern,
# and also current line matches another pattern, then use some fields of this line
# to fill a template and print the result. Always store current line in 'prev' variable."

# BEGIN  matches begining of input
